# BloodManagement
To succesfully run this application you should also have BloodBank.bak downloaded to your C: disk. 
Add it to mssql as follows:
Databases -> Restore Database -> Device -> Add -> BloodBank.bak -> OK everywhere. 
Now, open DataBase.cs in Visual Studio and change Data Source to your server name. 
Special thanks to @CyberDanger on YT, his tutorials were really helpful.
